<p style="color:white; font-size:large;text-align:justified;"> There once lived a girl whose name was 
Railey she LOVED horror movies she would watch the scariest before sleep she was getting
 ready to watch the movie at night after dinner when her little sister Mia came up to
 her crying Railey was suprised and asked "Why are you crying" Mia replied 
"M-Mom said we are moving" Railey also started to feel sad alot but did not beilieve her
 after some time Mia is quite the prankster so she didn't beilieve her Railey went strait
 to her mom Rita and asked "Are we moving ?" Rita replied "Yes,Am sorry i didn't tell you 
before dear" Railey's Heart broke into two peices she was really sad because her friends 
where in the city they where recently then she realisd her birthday is coming up and this 
might be a gift.
<br>
<br>
She thought they might move to her dream country Japan she had heard there 
are lot of legends about ghosts there so she asked her where they are moving to her mom 
replied "Some old city called Carven Hills" Railey got a little memory about Carvern Hills 
but she wasn't sure though the next morning she skipped school and reasearched about Carvern
 Hills and found out many Report videos she clicked the first in sight and saw a news reporter 
whose name was Callie and is turned out that she was missing 2 weeks right after the report.
Railey wanted to know more about this Callie lady and she found out she actually went to live 
<br>
<br>
in Carvern Hills for a few days for a little more information and turns out thats when she went
 missing Callie's roomate also knows as the camera girl Sia had made a report and the day Callie
 went missing Railey clicked the video cut didn't seem to get a clear video the adiuo and video 
seemed to b unclear she could see it very blurry and hardly hear it So Railey decided to meet this 
Sia lady and find out more Railey was very curiouse about Carvern hills Beacuse she had heard about 
<br>
<br>
it a long time ago.That ight when she closed her eyes to fall asleep she had a little thought and
 rememberd she had learned it in one of her history classes she rememberd they took the classes on 
Carvern hills for a day or two and she rememberd her teacher didn't come to teach anymore after
 that lesson rummor in the school is that she got sick and died but Railey knew that wasn't true 
she knew her teacher was alive but no one listened to her soon day after day she also beilieved her
 teacher was dead soon after she forgot about it.3days later Railey shifted to her new house which
<br>
<br>
 was Huge bigger then her old house She was excited and she realised her friends are not that far away from her
so when she was curiouse about Carvern Hills and she went to her neighboors house and knocked on her door 
to find an old lady who was not that active.Yes, she was active but not that much Her name was Margret But Railey
Called her Ms.M but Ms.M has alot of weird paintings on her wall which had 2 talll creature one which was 
orange and one was blue Railey did not care that much and went on with her daily activities she made some friends 
<br>
<br>
Their names where seana and bursia Railey thought those where weird names for 2 girls but they where twins so she 
had nothing to do about it the next day at her new school she met her class teacher who turned out to be her teacher
who was informed to be dead Miss Katherine the students call her Miss.Kate for short Railey hugged Miss.Kate 
But miss.Kate hesitated to find out who is was and saw her price student Railey and hugged back 
Soon Railey invited her class Teacher for dinner at there house and her familey Loved her Class teacher 
Railey soon found out her teacher lives buy.But she still had this one doubt on why Miss.Kate did not
Return back to their old school Soon when her Teacher Miss.Kate was visiting Railey,Railey was on a video call
<br>
<br>
With her two friends back home When they two suddenly noticed Miss.Kate in the Background and then Railey
Said "Hey guys i found Miss.Kate here" and thats when Miss.kate said "DONT SAY THEM" Railey got Suspiscouse
and said back to her two friends "Oh i meant my old friend Katie M-Miissholgin yah" Railey had found
Out her teacher facked everything like her death Railey asked Miss.Kate "W-Why did u say me not to
say them i found you here ?" Miss.Kate said "I have to feed my cats now bye!" and left 
The next day she had a dream about two creatures one which was blue and one which was orange
just like in Ms.M's wall paintings in her dream she saw her being controled by
<br>
<br>
by Seana and Bursia ? Railey was scared cause in her dream the creatures appeared like Seana
and Bursia but they where huge and the blue one was something like it was holding water ? 
and the orange one was holding fire ? Railey was Confused and scared at the same time
the next day she went to the library to barrow some books to cheer her up and 
forget about everything which has been happening and thats when she saw..The
History of the Carvern Hills she imiadatly and the book said
<br>
<br>
"The History of Carvern hills is not like the others 
this History is both scary and Confusing and it all started with two sisters 
whose names where Seana and Bursia they say people with theses names
arethe rebirths of them.Thease sisters cared for eachother and where smart
and cunning they both grew stronger with every time they interact with  their element 
they grow stronger like is Seana interacted with water she would grow stronger and if Bursia
Interacted with fire she would grow stronger Carvern hills people soon started to know more and more
day by day they would turn off the lights and drain the water because is Seana and Bursia gro stronger 
they make distruction Bursia would burn the place and Seana would flood the area but Carvern Hill's New Mayor did not Know about this
he insisted all the lights where on and there must be water in the well and everywhere water is needed thats when Seana and 
Bursia grew stronger they soon started to live with water and fire soon they where powerfull enough and drowned and burned the town
after that insident everyone kept their mouth shut."
<br>
<br>
Railey couldn't beilieve what that book said she imidiatly knew she had to do something
she knew she should not talk with Seana and Bursia but then she got upand found a letter
it said "Break the aincent rime stone" Railey did not know what the Aincent Rime stone was
she did a little reasearch and found out that the Rime Stone is an Aincent stone
which is found in some towns which are beilieved they have a curse
and they could be found in a cave which has alot of traps which people have died in 
Railey did not know what to do and was scared alot Luckily her Sister Mia knew about theese kind of traps
but Railey knew if she explained about this to Mia she will get scared so Railey 
Said mia its a test and Mia agreed and they said their parents they are going on a sister
trip while Seana and Bursia where getting stronger second by second 
<br>
<br>
They went searching for days and finally found the cave Mia was scared so was Railey 
But Mia had to try and Railey had to sucseed they got past the first trap and saw there where 2 more they 
hardly made threw the 2nd and Railey almost lost a leg in the 3rd one They went on and found the Aincent Rime Stone
and it was time to break it but turns out they where too late the cave started filling with warm water
they had to break the stone but they had to swim there and mia was not good at swiming but Railey was.
Railey swam as fast as she could and she tried to break it as the water turned hotter
she threw it to mia and mia couldn't break it Railey and Mia had to get out of the cave as fast as possible
after bareley escaping alive Railey and Mia tried to break the stone but they couldn't that when Railey realised it needed
3 hands to break it and thats when Miss.Kate arrived with a not so happy face and thats when Miss.Kate said
<br>
<br>
"The town is in danger" Railey,Mia and Katherine knew what to do now they all gatherd around
and Miss.Kate said the words and the stone just had a little crack on it they tried as hard as they could 
and the area they where standing in was starting to flood with warm water They said it
as loud as they could but when they where about to drown in the warm water Railey shouted out the word in the top
of her lings as fast as she could and the stone finally broke Seana and Bursia where shrinking and they dissapeard
soon the whole twon was perfect thats when The book Railey had "The History Of Carvern Hills" Dropped a tiny note
which said "Onece their gone after sometime a stone guardian will rise" Railey didn't really read it properley 
And carried on with her life in 
<br>
<br>
A phew days later she goes to Sia's house to investigate to find a book about "The Stone Guardian"
Then Sia says "Its you"....
